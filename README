NAME
    Test::t - 0 to testing in 1 line

VERSION
    version 0.0031

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Test::t;

        ok( 1 )

        ...

    Which is equivalent to

        #!/usr/bin/env perl

        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Most 'no_plan';

        ...

    With a custom plan

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Test::t tests => 8;

        ...

DESCRIPTION
    Test::t will get you testing in one short line. It will import
    Test::Most, activate strict and warnings, and issue 'no_plan' (unless
    you specify a plan manually)

    The (non-existent) interface is in flux and will be changed soon.
